# htpasswd
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) package for HTTP Basic Authentication password file utility.

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/gevorg/htpasswd.png)](https://travis-ci.org/gevorg/htpasswd)
[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/gevorg/htpasswd.png)](https://david-dm.org/gevorg/htpasswd)

## Installation

Via git (or downloaded tarball):

```bash
$ git clone git://github.com/gevorg/htpasswd.git
```
Via [npm](http://npmjs.org/):

```bash
$ npm install -g htpasswd
```	
## Command line usage

```bash
$ htpasswd [-cimpsDv] passwordfile username
$ htpasswd -b[cmpsDv] passwordfile username password

$ htpasswd -n[imps] username
$ htpasswd -nb[mps] username password
```	

## Script usage
```
var htpasswd = require("htpasswd");

// Verifies that the hash corresponds to the password
htpasswd.verify("$apr1$esYVbnli$quFMF4h/3XrNnHl08RYKc.", "root"); // Returns true, because "$apr1$es..." is the hash of "root"

// SYNCHRONOUSLY verifies that the user "root" has password "root" in the file ".htpasswd"
htpasswd.verifyFile(".htpasswd", "root", "root"); // Returns either "Password for user root correct." or "Password verification failed."

// Asynchronous version
require("fs").readFile(".htpasswd", {encoding:"UTF8"} function(err, contents) {
    if (err) throw err;
    htpasswd.verifyRaw(contents, "root", "root"); // Returns either "Password for user root correct." or "Password verification failed."
});
```

## Options

 - `-b` - Use the password from the command line rather than prompting for it. This option should be used with extreme care, since the password is clearly visible on the command line. For script use see the -i option.
 - `-i` - Read the password from stdin without verification (for script usage).
 - `-c` - Create a new file.
 - `-n` - Don't update file; display results on stdout.
 - `-m` - Use MD5 for passwords. This is the default.
 - `-d` - Use crypt() encryption for passwords. This algorithm limits the password length to 8 characters. This algorithm is insecure by today's standards.
 - `-s` - Use SHA for passwords. This algorithm is insecure by today's standards.
 - `-p` - Do not encrypt the password (plaintext).
 - `-D` - Delete the specified user.
 - `-v` - Verify password. Verify that the given password matches the password of the user stored in the specified htpasswd file.

## Running tests

It uses [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/), so just run following command in package directory:

```bash
$ npm test
```
